# statamic-hackcss

This is a <em>finished</em>* theme for Statamic.

## What can it be used for?

It's intended for usage on a website where the layout would be 

``` 
\ (home)
\articles
\blog
```

It should be expandable to other uses along these lines, but if you want it to.

It's intended for software developers, article sites, tutorials.

## What's included

- Content
- Settings
- Theme Folder

Overwrite these folders/files. Select the Theme 'hackcss' if required in Settings\Themes.

## Licence

[MIT Licence](https://github.com/t94xr/statamic-hackcss/blob/master/LICENSE)

## Support

Raise an issue with or contribute code/changes to the project, I'll do my best - I'm not a full time theme developer.

* Help in would be appreciated :)
